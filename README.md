# SMART CRADLE SYSTEM USING IOT
This IoT-powered cradle provides a remote monitoring solution, featuring a cry-detection mechanism, live video feed, and a user-friendly interface. It ensures infant comfort by monitoring bed humidity and temperature, offering peace of mind to parents who are away at work.
## Components Required
### Arduino Uno
Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which
6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator (CSTCE16M0V53-R0), a USB
connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the
microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or
battery to get started.
### B. GSM Module
A GSM module is a a hardware device that uses GSM mobile telephone technology to provide a data link to a
remote network. From the view of the mobile phone network, they are essentially identical to an ordinary
mobile phone, including the need for a SIM to identify themselves to the network. GSM modems typically
provide TTL-level serial interfaces to their host. They are usually used as part of an embedded system.
### C.Servo Motor
A servo motor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position,
velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback. It also
requires a relatively sophisticated controller, often a dedicated module designed specifically for use with servo
motors.
### D. Wet Sensor
It detects the moisture in crib when baby urinate and send signal to arduino.
E. Condenser microphone
A condenser microphone is an active transducer that converts sound waves (mechanical wave energy) into
audio signals (electrical energy) via the movement of a diaphragm in a fixed-charge capacitor-based capsule
and electrostatic principles
### F. WIFI- Camera
A Wireless cameras work by transmitting the camera's video through a radio (RF) transmitter. The video is sent
to a receiver that is connected to a built-in storage device or through cloud storage. Through your monitor or
receiver, you'll have an easy link to access all of your image or video clips.
